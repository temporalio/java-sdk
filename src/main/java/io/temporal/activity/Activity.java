/**
 * An activity is the implementation of a particular task in the business logic.
 *
 * <h2>Activity Interface</h2>
 *
 * <p>Activities are defined as methods of a plain Java interface. Each method defines a single
 * activity type. A single workflow can use more than one activity interface and call more than one
 * activity method from the same interface. The only requirement is that activity method arguments
 * and return values are serializable to a byte array using the provided {@link
 * io.temporal.common.converter.DataConverter} implementation. The default implementation uses JSON
 * serializer, but an alternative implementation can be easily configured.
 *
 * <p>Example of an interface that defines four activities:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * public interface FileProcessingActivities {
 *
 *     void upload(String bucketName, String localName, String targetName);
 *
 *     String download(String bucketName, String remoteName);
 *
 *     {@literal @}ActivityMethod(scheduleToCloseTimeoutSeconds = 2)
 *     String processFile(String localName);
 *
 *     void deleteLocalFile(String fileName);
 * }
 *
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * An optional {@literal @}{@link ActivityMethod} annotation can be used to specify activity options
 * like timeouts or a task list. Required options that are not specified through the annotation must
 * be specified at run time.
 *
 * <h2>Activity Implementation</h2>
 *
 * <p>Activity implementation is an implementation of an activity interface. A single instance of
 * the activity's implementation is shared across multiple simultaneous activity invocations.
 * Therefore, the activity implementation code must be <i>thread safe</i>.
 *
 * <p>The values passed to activities through invocation parameters or returned through a result
 * value are recorded in the execution history. The entire execution history is transferred from the
 * Temporal service to workflow workers when a workflow state needs to recover. A large execution
 * history can thus adversely impact the performance of your workflow. Therefore, be mindful of the
 * amount of data you transfer via activity invocation parameters or return values. Other than that,
 * no additional limitations exist on activity implementations.
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * public class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {
 *
 *     private final AmazonS3 s3Client;
 *
 *     private final String localDirectory;
 *
 *     void upload(String bucketName, String localName, String targetName) {
 *         File f = new File(localName);
 *         s3Client.putObject(bucket, remoteName, f);
 *     }
 *
 *     String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {
 *         // Implementation omitted for brevity.
 *         return downloadFileFromS3(bucketName, remoteName, localDirectory + localName);
 *     }
 *
 *     String processFile(String localName) {
 *         // Implementation omitted for brevity.
 *         return compressFile(localName);
 *     }
 *
 *     void deleteLocalFile(String fileName) {
 *         File f = new File(localDirectory + fileName);
 *         f.delete();
 *     }
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <h3>Accessing Activity Info</h3>
 *
 * <p>The {@link Activity} class provides static getters to access information about the workflow
 * that invoked it. Note that this information is stored in a thread-local variable. Therefore,
 * calls to Activity accessors succeed only in the thread that invoked the activity function.
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * public class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {
 *
 *      {@literal @}Override
 *      public String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {
 *         log.info("namespace=" +  Activity.getNamespace());
 *         WorkflowExecution execution = Activity.getWorkflowExecution();
 *         log.info("workflowId=" + execution.getWorkflowId());
 *         log.info("runId=" + execution.getRunId());
 *         ActivityTask activityTask = Activity.getTask();
 *         log.info("activityId=" + activityTask.getActivityId());
 *         log.info("activityTimeout=" + activityTask.getStartToCloseTimeoutSeconds());
 *         return downloadFileFromS3(bucketName, remoteName, localDirectory + localName);
 *      }
 *      ...
 *  }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <h3>Asynchronous Activity Completion</h3>
 *
 * <p>Sometimes an activity lifecycle goes beyond a synchronous method invocation. For example, a
 * request can be put in a queue and later a reply comes and is picked up by a different worker
 * process. The whole request-reply interaction can be modeled as a single Temporal activity.
 *
 * <p>To indicate that an activity should not be completed upon its method return, call {@link
 * Activity#doNotCompleteOnReturn()} from the original activity thread. Then later, when replies
 * come, complete the activity using {@link io.temporal.client.ActivityCompletionClient}. To
 * correlate activity invocation with completion use either {@code TaskToken} or workflow and
 * activity IDs.
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * public class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {
 *
 *      public String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {
 *          byte[] taskToken = Activity.getTaskToken(); // Used to correlate reply
 *          asyncDownloadFileFromS3(taskToken, bucketName, remoteName, localDirectory + localName);
 *          Activity.doNotCompleteOnReturn();
 *          return "ignored"; // Return value is ignored when doNotCompleteOnReturn was called.
 *      }
 *      ...
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * When the download is complete, the download service potentially calls back from a different
 * process:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 *     public <R> void completeActivity(byte[] taskToken, R result) {
 *         completionClient.complete(taskToken, result);
 *     }
 *
 *     public void failActivity(byte[] taskToken, Exception failure) {
 *         completionClient.completeExceptionally(taskToken, failure);
 *     }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <h3>Activity Heartbeating</h3>
 *
 * <p>Some activities are long running. To react to their crashes quickly, use a heartbeat
 * mechanism. Use the {@link Activity#heartbeat(Object)} function to let the Temporal service know
 * that the activity is still alive. You can piggyback `details` on an activity heartbeat. If an
 * activity times out, the last value of `details` is included in the ActivityTimeoutException
 * delivered to a workflow. Then the workflow can pass the details to the next activity invocation.
 * This acts as a periodic checkpointing mechanism of an activity's progress.
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * public class FileProcessingActivitiesImpl implements FileProcessingActivities {
 *
 *      {@literal @}Override
 *      public String download(String bucketName, String remoteName, String localName) {
 *         InputStream inputStream = openInputStream(file);
 *         try {
 *             byte[] bytes = new byte[MAX_BUFFER_SIZE];
 *             while ((read = inputStream.read(bytes)) != -1) {
 *                 totalRead += read;
 *                 f.write(bytes, 0, read);
 *                 // Let the service know about the download progress.
 *                 Activity.heartbeat(totalRead);
 *             }
 *         }finally{
 *             inputStream.close();
 *         }
 *      }
 *      ...
 * }
 * </code></pre>
