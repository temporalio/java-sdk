Highlights:
* Deadlock detector will now show all workflow threads making debugging easier.
* SDK will no longer use illegal reflective access during exception unwrapping.
* Fixed a bug with missing cancellation in child sub-scopes.
* Added binary checksum to the worker options, which can now be used in the auto-reset.
* Added an option to run only workflow task and local activity pollers.
* Fixed an issue with eager activity task pre-fetching which could be causing activity timeouts when all handlers are busy.
