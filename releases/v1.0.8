Highlights

* Option to set default ActivityOptions and per activityType. Can be done
through the activityStub, WorkflowImplementationOptions, and on a workflow.
* Added context propagation for local activities
* Option to set initial time for workflow tests
* Implemented a Health Check. By default it's on and checks if the server is up
every 5s. If the server is not up in 10s, the worker will not start. It may break
those users that deploy workers while server is not up. Please configure in 
WorkflowServiceStubsOptions.
